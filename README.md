Library Management System
=========================
---
This is the starter code for the course project for COMP 8042 in BCIT. 
The project is split into multiple chunks and each chunk will be released as a separate
homework and will have its own test cases. Once you are done with the homework, you will
put that module with the rest of the components and after the last homework, you will have 
a completed working project. As a first step, please make yourself familiarized with the 
general framing of the project and the placeholder files on which we will work throughout
the semester. Here are the top level directories in the project and some explanations on 
how you would be doing each module:

* `docs`: contains the homework descriptions, one separate `.md` file for each.
* `include`: contains the implementation of the algorithms and datastructures required for each module.
* `resources`: contains the library circulation data which will be used to populate the library data.
* `src`: contains the `.cpp` source code implementation files.
* `tests`: contains the module testing and grading header files.
